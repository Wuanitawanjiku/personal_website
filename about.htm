        <br><br>

        <p>Growing up, I had a dream of what it was I wanted, like every other child did. I wasn't really tied down to one thing, and I don't think any child is either.
             I grew up associating food with love, and my family was always trying to share a lot of great meals with me all from differnt cultures and up till this day I'm still left with the memories of the first time 
             I had Chinese food. I really enjoyed my time with my family, at our grandma's city home. 
             I am one who finds the joy in the little things in life and by spending quality time with my loved ones I get to make treasourable memories. I am the second born in a family of four
            siblings and have spent most if not all my life living with my extended family.</p>
    <br><br><br>

        <p>When I got to high school, things had started to change.I got exposed to challenges I never thought I'd be able to overcome and that's where I actually
            got to realise just how strong challenges can make one. To be honest, high school was quite a journey I and actually thank God with every passing day that 
            I made it through. Academics aside, it is in high school that I actaully got to grow certain disciplines that the world needs you to have and it will never 
            teach you.</p> 
 </p>
            <br><br><br>

             <p>Unlike my friends or classmates back then in high school, I literally didn't have the freedom to go or do however I'd wish cause my 
                 mum was one of the 'over-protective' parents. Not that she didn't trust me enough, or my sister, just that she believed we were much safer
                 being in our own space just like what her mother, my grandmother believed when she was raising them. I got to train myself goal setting and gain extra
                  skills during my time in the house. I also promised to reward myself by trying something new being a person who isn't quite great at taking risks.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            
           <p>  Soon after high school, I became friends with the internet. In the course of our friendship, I got to learn how to bake cakes. Amazing ones such that I was 
                able to take some orders. Having recently got a schoolarship to study at AkiraChix Campus, a Tech-based girls' only institution where I'm pursuing
programming, I get to challenge myself and learn new things with each passing minute.I have so far come to develop a meaningful perspective 
towards life as I engage in developing skills that will be of great use in the days to come.</p>

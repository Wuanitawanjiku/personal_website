    <p>Abel Shingange, is extensively talked about by Trevor in his memoir. From Trevor's childhood onwards, when he and his mother bring their Volkswagen in for 
        repairs, the auto mechanic Abel is  a constant fixture in their lives. When Noah was six years old, his mom Patricia started dating Abel. Abel moderately
        handsome, funny and charismatic. The world knew him as a good man. But at home he was a warewolf. <br>When Patricia told Noah she was getting married to Abel, Trevor 
        tried talking her out of it, not that he was angry or jealous, he just had an inclination that Abel was bad news. Noah was indeed right to think this way since he had 
        once seen Abel's fury the night at the mulberry tree when he beat up a child. Furthermore, Abel's name in itself held the answer to his character. His Tsonga name was Ngisaveni,
        which meant "be afraid."</p>
        <br><br><br>

        <p>It's quite evident that once Patricia married Abel, she started to lose control of her life. Abel tried to make the family a traditional Tsonga family. The firstborn in the Tsoga tradition
            is cherished, especially if it's a son. For Abel, bringing home his firstborn son was a monumental event, and Patricia was 'supposed' to play the dutiful woman. Her refusal to perform the customs 
        was therefore taken as a personal affront. Abel felt he was being disrespected. He even went to the extent of creating new rules for the house, such as relegating Fufi and Panther to the yard. This he did
    with the intentions of showing his 'dominance' and manly hood while in real essence he could not not control anyone let alone his drinking. All he could was become physically violent. <br>One night Patricia and Noah awoke 
to a fire in the kitchen. Abel had come home late and drunk as usual, he happened to pass out with a pot on a burner. Patricia woke him up and cursed him for being so irresponsible. She started yelling at him and after Abel 
had taken it for a minute, he smacked her across the face, so hard she went flying. Patricia couldn't believe it for it was her first time being hit by a man. She got back up and and kept arguing and he hit her again. This defines 
just the best that Abel could do to 'silence' her or rather make her 'bow' to him. Yet Patricia did the exact opposite. She took the boys to Soweto, Abel was the one who followed a few weeks later to apologize. </p>
<br><br><br>

<p>Patricia quit her job and started doing the books to help Abel off. She ably used her office skills to turn things around. She made it work and customers together with vendors noticed. But on Abel's side, he started to feel like
    she was taking over the business, and he didn't like that one bit. But after a year of striving for nothing, she found another secretarial job and bought a house in Highland North. Soon afterwards, Abel's garage closed and he moved his shop 
to the back yard. In all instances in as much as Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife, I can't quite comprehend how the stability of the family would be measured in a family where the husband is constantly drunk and inapproachable.</p>
<br><br><br>

<p>For someone like Patricia, an 'exotic bird' was the perfect catch for Abel. Abel probably got attracted to her for one reason and one reason alone, her independence. From the frequent garage visits, he probably established and made calcualted moves on 
    how he is going to cage her. Unfortunately Patricia fell into his trap and stripped herself off her independence. What started off as 'love', slowly went to first time hit, gradually graduated into unexplained abuse and then from abuse to attempted murder.
But abuse was part of the life for African women. No one stepped in, not even the police. What was she supposed to do when she was in a male-driven society with children from different fathers? A society that refused to acknolweldge her suffering?</p>

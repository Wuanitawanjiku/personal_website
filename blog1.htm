    <div class="Paragraphs"> 
    <p> Trevor Noah, a South African-born international stand-up comedian published a literary autobiography, Born a Crime(2016) in which 
        he recounts his life in a multiracial country,South Africa through humour that not only recognizes the absurdities of the world but 
    also criticizes ills in the society. He uses humour as a tool to criticize and satirize the ills in the society through his experiences.
The use of a child's perspective helps in appreciating his line of thought and perception of social issues. </p>
<br><br><br>

<p>As Noah got older, he turned to stand-up, mining his life experiences for laughs - even the very painful ones,as when his step-father, -in a drunken 
    rage shot Noah's mother twice and left her for dead. Humor helped his family heal. His mother was the first one to make a joke looking at him and she goes,
"Shh," she said."Don't cry, baby.Shhhhh. Don't cry."..."My child you must look on the bright side...Now you're officially the best looking person in the family."
They both broke into a huge smile and started laughing. </p>
<br><br><br>

<p>Trevor Noah's satire is dictated by his choice of words. He is able to keep his audience entertained and also criticize inhuman values in the society.
    Even though Trevor evokes a lot of laughter, the message being passed across makes us as the readers empathize with him. His humour conceals a melancholy 
    born out of years of suffering and pain. His birth -its meaning and implication- is already contentious because there are laws that prohibit inter-racial unions.
    Trevor is born of an African mother and a German-Swiss father, Patricia Nombuyiselo and Robert respectively.
    Trevor Noah deliberately uses circumlocution and hyperbole to present the fact of his birth in a humorous way. He states that when her mother's delivery was taking  place,
    the doctors "cut open her belly, and reached in and pulled out a half-white half-black child" who is essentially seen to have violated the laws thereby being born illegally.
    He makes fun out of his own birth, painting himself as a child who is unwanted. He says: "I was born a crime".</p>
    <br><br><br>

    <p>Animal imagery, vivid description and humour are as well used to refer to the police as hippos. The police are compared to "an occupying army" who were in riot gear. They are said to
        be militarized ready for any action vented on the blacks. In contrast, the police in white neighbourhoods were not only friendly but also dressed in coloured shirts and pressed pants.
        It is also hilarious that despite belonging to a particular race, there were systems which divided one's livelihood or race. Changes could be made at any time and Trevor Noah presents 
        this facts hypothetically where a policeman has to ensure there is a separation of races but is unable to separate the Chinese from Japanese. He speculates in an also humorous way on what the 
        policeman would say to a Japanese man sitting on a bench in a white's park. <br>'Hey, get off that bench, you Chinaman!'<br> 'Excuse me, I'm Japanese.'<br> 'Oh, I apologize, sir. I didn't mean to be
         racist. Have a lovely afternoon.'</p>
         <br><br><br>

    <p>Trevor's expertise in languages gives him acceptance among the black students and courage to interact freely without feeling alienated. He asserts that speaking another peron's language bribes
        the person to see him as part of them. <br>This is the reason black students loved his company. He identified himself as the 'funny guy' in the groups he used to hang out with and that to him was enough 
        help him interact with the all kinds of groups. From the 'cool kids' to the 'nerds'. The use of multiple African languages together with his humour makes it easier for him to get along and make 
    friends. He humourously protected himself from other children who spoke in Zulu when plotting to mug him because of his whiteness. He resorts to Zulu asking them if he could join them and steal. </p>
    <br><br><br>

    <p>The title of the chapter 'Run' is both metaphorical and humourously used. Trevor is an athlete champion at Maryvale College of which he credits his mother for his success  because he routinely ran away from her<br> 
        whenever she wanted to whip him when he says,"she was always chasing me to kick my ass and I was always running not to get my ass kicked."</p>
        <br><br><br>
    
        <p>When Noah's mother resorts to letter writing to tame his son, Trevor also humourously uses the same practice to get back at his mother. He says,"our life turned into a courtroom drama with two lawyers constantly
            debating over loopholes and technicalities". One instance he gives is when Nombuyiselo(his mother) comments on his poor performance in school, he would allude to her poor grades too and how naughty she was as a child.
        </p>
        <br><br><br>

        <p>Trevor Noah also expresses two differing opinions on religion when he steals a bowl of custard and jelly from the fridge. His action causes him stomachache which hinders him from getting out of bed. He juxtaposes his religious
            ideologies and his mother's. Whereas his mother is tied to the doctrines on how praying to Jesus brings healing, his believes however taking medicine and then praying to Jesus to thank him for the doctors for their invention of medicine 
        is right. Trevor Noah finds himself not just once or twice having to question certain religious instances in his life. He uses flashback to recount certain events in his childhood to juxtapose the differences in peoples' social beliefs as well as his own.
        As a child he could also not understand why he was subjected to long hours in Church which would make him starve yet he is obstructed from sharing the sacrament since he is a non-Catholic.
